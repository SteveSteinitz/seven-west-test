### Run

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

###Notes

React and Styled-Components project for Seven West technical test.  Created with create-react-app.

Added Enzyme for a simple existence test.  Had to downgrade from Node 10 to node 9 to get it working.

Decided to make a separate Banner component for the transparent bottom banner.

###Limitations

No support for older Microsoft browsers.  Only tested in Mac Chrome.

No effort toward responsiveness nor accessibility.

Didn't find a sensible way to resize the content div to the background image, so hard coded the image size. Ideas welcome.
